OOPS:
-> Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming approach that organizes software design around objects,
 where objects represent real-world entities containing both data and behavior, enabling modular, reusable and maintainable code.

-> There are four main pillars of OOPS: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

1.Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods together inside a class and protecting the data from direct access.
Example:
In a bank account, the balance is hidden and can be accessed only through methods like deposit or getBalance.

2.Abstraction:
Abstraction means hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user.
Example:
An ATM allows users to withdraw money, but hides how the bank server processes the transaction.

3.Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
Example:
A SportsCar inherits common features like color, tyres and methods from a Car.

4.Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means one method can perform different actions based on the object that calls it.
Example:
The same pay() method can process cash payment or UPI payment depending on the payment type.
